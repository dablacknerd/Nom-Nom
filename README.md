Nom Nom
============
Nom Nom is a restuarant location app that lets you search for restuarants within a 5 mile radius of your current location, using restuarant name or cuisine type. It returns restuarants in your location and you can view details such as the phone number or address of the restuarant. A Map It button in the restuarant details section, allows you to launch Apple Maps from within the app, with directions from your current location to the restuarants location.
The current version is a prototype version i put together over the course of a weekend.
